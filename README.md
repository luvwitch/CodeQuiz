## Quiz 

Each question is a new block that replaces the last with four multiple choice answers, each with a radio button, and a next button to move on to the nxt question. A timer begins, adding seconds to the clock for every correct answer and docking seconds for every incorrect answer. A correct answer nets you 20 points!

## Your Score

Once all five questions are answered and submitted, the timer will stop and a new page with a form to enter your name to the high scores page will appear. It automatically adds your score to the end of your name, updates the list, and will show you any other locally saved players who have submitted their names!

## Highscores

From the start screen you can access the entire high scores list before you even take the quiz. A good way to see how everyone else is scoring and challenge yourself to do better!
